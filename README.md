Making Modifications to This Script

Once you have obtained and unzipped the source files, you will need to make one modification to the R file before you can process the data.

Project Description

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
